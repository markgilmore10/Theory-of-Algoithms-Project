## Problem Statement
You must write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input.  
The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force.  
The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.

## The MD5 Algorithm

[The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.  
Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.  It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.  
It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database.  
MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4 and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)
